1. What is unit testing?
we have to test any smallest component of any appication such as individual methods of each class or something else to make the code bug free.

2.What are the different kinds of testing required to release the application for production?

i) Unit testing-- testing the smallest  component of the application such as individual methods of each class.

ii)Integration testing - Testing for the integrated components  of the application  or integrated modules of the application to ensure that modules are working as expected
after integrating.

iii)System testing or End to end testing - testing for complete and fully integrated application from the start journy to end Journey.

iv)Acceptance testing - Testing to check whether the application  is able to meet the user's expctations and whether user is accepting the changes or not. 


3. Why should we use Junit?
If we do the testing by main method and we use System.out.println() everyWhere ,we have to observe the console everywhere and that is not a good approach. If we have 100 
classes then it is not possible to do it manually. So for this case we need some API or some tool to solve this issue and JUNIT can do that.
